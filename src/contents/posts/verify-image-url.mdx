description: one of the rare cases that I need to work with MIME types in frontend web development
---

In a side project I built, I had an input field that let users to pass urls that are supposed to link to image files, and I wanted to add client-side validation for that.

I started with the most obvious solution: regular expressions.

## Regex

A list of common image file types that are supported by most browsers can be found on [this MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types). I can check if the url ends with one of these file extensions:

```javaScript
function isImgUrl(url) {
  return /\.(jpg|jpeg|png|webp|avif|gif)$/.test(url)
}
```

The most obvious drawback with this approach is that I have to list out every single possible image file extension in the regex. 

Also, it is based on a false premise: all image urls must have the correct file extension appended at the end. The reality is, on the web, file extensions don't really matter. For example, this url `https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33640448?v=4` links to my [Github profile picture](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33640448?v=4), but it doesn't end up with any image file extension. The current solution fails to cover this edge case.

## Image's onload event

Another approach is to create an image tag `<img >` dynamically in JavaScript and assigning the url to its `src` attribute. If the `onload` event fires off, then that means the browser can correctly decode the image data linked by the url. Thus we know it is indeed an image url.

```jsx
function isImgUrl(url) {
  const img = new Image();
  img.src = url;
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    img.onload = () => resolve(true);
    img.onerror = () => resolve(false);
  });
}
```

This approach works with urls that don't have file extensions attached.

```jsx
function isImgUrl(url) {
  const img = new Image();
  img.src = url;
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    img.onerror = () => resolve(false);
    img.onload = () => resolve(true);
  });
}

const urls = [
  'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33640448?v=4',
  'https://httpbin.org/image/webp',
  'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/June_odd-eyed-cat.jpg'
];

Promise.all(urls.map((url) => isImgUrl(url))).then(console.log); // [true, true ,true]
```

However, by assigning the `url` to the `src` attribute of an image tag, the browser kicks off a `Get` request to download *the whole image* when we don't plan to actually render anything yet. This solution doesn't scale well if we have hundreds of urls to check.

## Sending HEAD requests and only check for the MIME type

Turns out there is a way to find out if a url links to an image file *without* incurring the cost of downloading. That is, to send a `HEAD` request to get the [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) from the `Content-Type` header. 

As we have seen previously, file extensions are not a *necessary* part of a url. Instead, browsers use [MIME Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) to interpret the contents of requested files. When a image file comes off the network, browsers look at the response's `Content-type` header for its MIME type and invoke the appropriate decoder to decompress the image file. 

Different image formats all start with the `image` MIME type, along with different subtypes. For example, the MIME type of a `jpeg` file is `image/jpeg`, and for a `png` file it is `image/png`. Therefore, we only need to check if the MIME type starts with `image`:


```jsx
function isImgUrl(url) {
  return fetch(url, {method: 'HEAD'}).then(res => {
    return res.headers.get('Content-Type').startsWith('image')
  })
}
```

Now without having to incur the overhead of a full response payload, we get to know if a given url links to an image file.

> Note that this is still not a production grade solution.
> There a few noticeable drawbacks to it: 1. it doesn't work when the request is rejected by CORS 2. it doesn't work with images formats that are not supported by browsers.
