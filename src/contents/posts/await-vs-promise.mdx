description: My takes on async/await vs Promise
---

Despite thousands of posts on `async/await` vs. `Promise` already existing, many of them left a lot to be desired. So I want to write up my own post on this topic.

The point I'd like to make in this post is that async/await is more than syntactic sugar on top of `Promise`, as `async/await` does offer tangible benefits:

- `async/await` allows us to use all the language constructs that are available in synchronous programming, resulting in more **expressive** and **readable** code;
- `async/await` unifies the experience of asynchronous programming; and
- `async/await` provides better error stack trace;
  > This blog post assumes basic knowledge of `Promise` and `async/await`. I am not here to compete with tutorials on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous) and [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/promise-basics).

## A little bit of history of async programming in JavaScript

Asynchronous programming is common in JavaScript. Whenever we need to make a web service call, a file access, or a database operation, asynchronicity is how we prevent the UI from being blocked despite the language being single-threaded.

Before the major upgrade JavaScript underwent in ES2015 (ES6), callbacks were how people dealt with asynchronous programming. The only way for us to express _temporal dependency_ (i.e. the execution order of asynchronous operations) is nesting one callback inside of the other. This led to so called [Callback Hell](http://callbackhell.com/).

> Reddit user [@theQuandary](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/wmpdsu/comment/ik2cnoh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) pointed out that before ES6, there were other better alternatives to asynchronous programming in JavaScript than callbacks. Sorry for not being 100% accurate here, as I wasn't around for much of that history.

`Promise` then was introduced in JavaScript in ES2015. It is a first-class object for asynchronous operations which we can easily pass around, compose, aggregate and apply transformations to. Temporal dependency is cleanly expressed via `then` method chaining.

  <p>
    The idea of `Promise` in JavaScript wasn’t original. It was inspired by a very old language
    called [E language](http://wiki.erights.org/wiki/Promise). Its creator [Mark
    Miller](https://twitter.com/marksammiller) is also a [TC39
    representative](https://tc39wiki.calculist.org/about/people/). And the `async/await` syntax was
    borrowed from [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/async).
  </p>

With `Promise` serving as a powerful primitive, it sounds like asynchronous programming is a solved issue in JavaScript, right?

Well, not quite yet, because sometimes `Promise` can be a little too low level to work with…

## Sometimes Promise can be too low level to work with

Despite the advent of `Promise`, there was still a need for a higher-level language construct for asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

Let's consider this example where we need a function to poll an API at some interval. It resolves to `null` when the maximum number of retries has met.

Here is one possible solution with `Promise`:

```jsx
let count = 0;

function apiCall() {
  return new Promise((resolve) =>
    // at 6th retry, it resolves to 'value'
    count++ === 5 ? resolve('value') : resolve(null)
  );
}

function sleep(interval) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, interval));
}

function poll(retry, interval) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    // skip error handling for brevity...

    if (retry === 0) resolve(null);
    apiCall().then((val) => {
      if (val !== null) resolve(val);
      else {
        sleep(interval).then(() => {
          resolve(poll(retry - 1, interval));
        });
      }
    });
  });
}

poll(6, 1000).then(console.log); // 'value'
```

How intuitive and readable this solution is would depend one's familiarity with `Promise`, how `Promise.resolve` "flats" `Promise` and recursion. To me, this is not the most readable way to write such a function.

<details>
    <summary>You can use `setInterval` instead</summary>
    <p>There is almost always another way to write a function. Here is a solution with `setInterval` written by my friend [James](https://twitter.com/jrsinclair):</p>
        ```jsx
        const pollInterval = (retry, interval) => {
            return new Promise((resolve) => {

                let intervalToken, timeoutToken;

                intervalToken = setInterval(async () => {
                    const result = await apiCall();
                    if (result !== null) {
                        clearInterval(intervalToken);
                        clearTimeout(timeoutToken);
                        resolve(result);
                    }
                }, interval);

                timeoutToken = setTimeout(() => {
                    clearInterval(intervalToken);
                    resolve(null);
                }, retry * interval);
                });
        };
        ```

</details>

## Enter async/await

Let's rewrite the above solution using the `async/await` syntax:

```jsx
async function poll(retry, interval) {
  while (retry >= 0) {
    const value = await apiCall().catch((e) => {}); // skip error handling for brevity...
    if (value !== null) return value;
    await sleep(interval);
    retry--;
  }

  return null;
}
```

I expect most people'd find the above solution _more readable_, because we are able to use all **normal language constructs** such as such as loops, `try-catch` for an asynchronous operations.

<details>
    <summary>The recursive approach</summary>
    <p>However, this is not strictly an apple-to-apple comparison as I switched from a recursive approach to an iterative approach. Let’s rewrite the above solution using recursion:</p>
        ```jsx
        const pollAsyncAwait = async (retry, interval) => {
            if (retry < 0) return null;

            const value = await apiCall().catch((e) => {}); // skip error handling for brevity...
            if (value !== null) return value;

            await sleep(interval);
            return pollAsyncAwait(retry - 1, interval);
        };
        ```

</details>

This is probably the biggest selling point of `async/await` - enabling you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous-looking way. On the other hand, this is where probably the most common objection to `async/await` comes from. More on that later.

By the way, `await` even has the right [operator precedence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence), so that `await a + await b` does mean `(await a) + (await b)`, as opposed to, let's say, `await (a + await b)`.

### async/await offers an unified experience across sync and async code

Another nice thing about `async/await` is that `await` automatically wraps any non-Promises (`non-thenable`s) into `Promise`s. The semantics of `await` equates to `Promise.resolve`, that means you can `await` anything:

```jsx
function fetchValue() {
  return 1;
}

async function fn() {
  const val = await fetchValue();
  console.log(val); // 1
}

// 👆 this is equal to the following

function fn() {
  Promise.resolve(fetchValue()).then((val) => {
    console.log(val); // 1
  });
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Note this is a browser-dependent behavior...</summary>
  <p>Saying `await foo` equals to `Promise.resolve(foo).then(...)` is not 100% accurate. </p>
  <p>
    Before Chrome 73, the ECMAScript spec translated `await foo` to `new Promise(resolve =>
    resolve(p))`. Then there was a change in the spec made in [this
    PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/1250). But until now, not every browser respects the
    change in the spec; as of this writing, Safari still hasn't implemented the updated spec. As a
    result, running [this
    snippet](https://gist.github.com/zhenghaohe/c90ec960b890eca60b7bd8008f856a70) in Safari gives
    you a different result from that in Chrome.
  </p>
</details>

If we were to attach the `then` method to the number `1` returned from `fetchValue`, the following error would occur:

```jsx
function fetchValue() {
  return 1;
}

function fn() {
  fetchValue().then((val) => {
    console.log(val);
  });
}

fn(); // ❌ Uncaught TypeError: fetchValue(...).then is not a function
```

Lastly, anything returned from an `async` function is always a `Promise`:

```jsx
Object.prototype.toString.call((async function () {})()); // '[object Promise]'
```

### async/await provides better error stack tracing

V8 engineer [Mathias](https://twitter.com/mathias) wrote a post called [Asynchronous stack traces: why await beats Promise#then()](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/async-stack-traces) covering why the engine has an easier time capturing and store stack trace for `async/await` compared to `Promise`.

Here is a demo:

```jsx
async function foo() {
  await bar();
  return 'value';
}

function bar() {
  throw new Error('BEEP BEEP');
}

foo().catch((error) => console.log(error.stack));

// Error: BEEP BEEP
//     at bar (<anonymous>:7:9)
//     at foo (<anonymous>:2:9)
//     at <anonymous>:10:1
```

The async version captures the error stack trace correctly.

Le's take a look at the `Promise` version:

```jsx
function foo() {
  return bar().then(() => 'value');
}

function bar() {
  return Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    throw new Error('BEEP BEEP');
  });
}

foo().catch((error) => console.log(error.stack));

// Error: BEEP BEEP  at <anonymous>:7:11
```

Stack trace is lost. Switching from anonymous arrow function to named function declaration helps a bit, but not by much:

```jsx
function foo() {
  return bar().then(() => 'value');
}

function bar() {
  return Promise.resolve().then(function thisWillThrow() {
    throw new Error('BEEP BEEP');
  });
}

foo().catch((error) => console.log(error.stack));

// Error: BEEP BEEP
//    at thisWillThrow (<anonymous>:7:11)
```

## Common objections to async/await

I've seen two common objections to `async/await`.

First, `async/await` can be a footgun when one [unnecessarily sequentializes](https://web.dev/javascript-async-functions/#careful!-avoid-going-too-sequential) _independent_ async function calls when they can be handled concurrently (or “in parallel” if we use the term loosely) with `Promise.all`.

This tends to happen when people try to muddle through asynchronous programming without truly understanding how `Promise` works behind the scenes.

The second one is more nuanced. Some [functional programming enthusiasts](https://dev.to/jesterxl/why-i-don-t-use-async-await-4amc) think `async/await` invites imperative style programming. From a FP programmer's point of view, being able to use loops and `try catch` is not a blessing, as those language constructs imply **side effects** and encourages less-than-ideal error handling.

I sympathize with this argument. FP programmers rightfully care about **certainty** in their programs. They want to be absolutely confident in their code. In order to get there, a sophisticated type system with types like [Result](https://folktale.origamitower.com/api/v2.3.0/en/folktale.result.html) is warranted. But I don't think `async/await` itself is incompatible with FP. My friend [James](https://twitter.com/jrsinclair), an expert in FP, said that there is an equivalent of `async/await` in Haskell - the [Do-notation](https://wiki.haskell.org/Keywords#do) feature.

Anyway, I think for most people, including me, FP remains an acquired taste (although I do think FP is super cool and I am slowly learning it). Normal control flow statements and `try catch` error handling provided by `async/await` are invaluable for us to orchestrate complicated asynchronous operations in JavaScript. That's precisely why saying "`async/await` is just a syntactic sugar" is an understatement.
