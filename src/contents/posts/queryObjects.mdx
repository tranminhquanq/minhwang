Memory leaks has been a relatively underdiscussed topic in the JavaScript community, largely because client-side JavaScript, shipped with web pages to browsers, are typically short-lived, compared with their server-side counterpart. Most of the times, a web page doesn't stay open for long and once the user refresh the page or close the tab, memory retained by JavaScript all get automatically released and recycled.

However, as the legendary Douglas Crockford predicted in his nearly 20-year-ago blog post [_JScript Memory Leaks_](http://www.crockford.com/javascript/memory/leak.html), the problem with memory leaks has become more prominent with the recent rise of SPA, where web pages are becoming **web apps** with much deeper user session.

Identifying and debugging JavaScript memory leaks has been mostly an effort involving taking heap snapshots, manually comparing them, cutting through the noise, and diffing out the culprit that caused the leaks. It is a time-consuming task that can‚Äôt be easily automated.

In this post I'll show you how we can leverage a lesser-known API called `queryObjects` to detect memory leaks in Chrome from the DevTools Console.

> Note that this post doesn't try to outline a comprehensive list of possible memory leaks in JavaScript applications and how to fix them. For those who are interested in that, I recommend [this](https://nolanlawson.com/2020/02/19/fixing-memory-leaks-in-web-applications/) and [this post](https://nolanlawson.com/2022/01/05/memory-leaks-the-forgotten-side-of-web-performance/) written by the amazing Nolan Lawson.

## Enter queryObjects

[queryObjects](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/utilities/#queryObjects-function) takes a constructor and returns an array of objects that were created with the input constructor.

```tsx
const array = new Uint8Array(1_000_000_000); // allocating 1GB memory
queryObjects(Uint8Array); // logs out an array of all existing uint8 arrays
```

At the surface it looks like an API to query how many instances of a given class has been created so far. However, it has [an undocumented feature](https://twitter.com/ChromeDevTools/status/1250355473661882369) of forcing a garbage collection whenever it's called.

My performance profiling results also confirm this.

Its ability to query live objects in memory after triggering a garbage collection is a perfect lens into memory allocation and can be served as an educational tool to observe and understand how memory leaks happens without having to look through and diff heap snapshots.

Beyond that, you can even write [automated tests](https://github.com/chrisguttandin/standardized-audio-context/blob/master/test/memory/module.js#L35) with it. Christoph Guttandin wrote a [blog post](https://media-codings.com/articles/automatically-detect-memory-leaks-with-puppeteer) on how to programmatically detect memory leaks by leveraging `queryObjects`.

<details>
  <summary>`queryObjects` is only available in Chrome</summary>
  <p>
    `queryObjects` is a Chrome DevTools API. I don't know if there are an exact equivalent in other
    browsers. But given how ubiquitous Chromium and V8 are in the current JavaScript landscape, the
    garbage collection behavior could very likely be consistent across different platforms and
    browsers. I am not 100% sure though.
  </p>

## Minimal reproducible memory leaks examples

Let's go through some examples where we apply `queryObjects` to detect memory leaks. The following examples are some of the most common memory leaks patterns, but by no means an exhaustive list.

### global object

Probably the most easy way to introduce memory leaks is by adding properties to global objects, like `window`.

This can happen accidentally under non-strict mode:

```tsx
function fn() {
  foo = new Uint8Array(1_000_000_000);
}

fn();
queryObjects(Uint8Array); // logs out an array of uint8Arrays
```

### closure

JavaScript is a celebration of closures, where a function can freely access free variables (i.e. variables declared outside the function).

Closure is what makes JavaScript an interesting language, but that doesn't come for free: the engine has to keep free variables in memory even after the function where those variables defined finishes execution. It causes _memory retention_, but we don't normally equate that to memory leaks, unless the browser itself is buggy.

In the following example, the returned function `bar` closes over object `test`, thus retaining the memory allocated for it.

```tsx
class Test {}

function foo() {
  const test = new Test();
  test.a = new Uint8Array(1_000_000_000);
  test.b = 'foo';

  return () => {
    console.log(test.b);
  };
}

const bar = foo();

queryObjects(Uint8Array); // ‚ùå [uint8Array]
queryObjects(Test); // ‚ùå [{Test}]
```

This is expected behavior: the returned function `bar` reads th`test`'s property, that's why its memory, along with the giant `Uint8Array`, is retained.

<details>
    <summary>how do we fix it?</summary>
    <p>
We can fix it by adding a separate reference to `test.b` and use that instead from the returned function.

```tsx
function foo() {
  const test = new Test();
  test.a = new Uint8Array(1_000_000_000);
  test.b = 'foo';

  const { b } = test;

  return () => {
    console.log(b);
  };
}

queryObjects(Uint8Array); // ‚úÖ empty array
queryObjects(Test); // ‚úÖ empty array
```

</p>
</details>

The memory retention is easy to identify in the above example. Perhaps a more confusing example is when you have a _write-only_ variables captured in the closure:

```tsx
function fn() {
  let a;

  return () => {
    a = new Uint8Array(1_000_000_000);
  };
}
const foo = fn();

foo();
```

In this example, `foo` doesn't _read_ variable `a` from its closure. It only _writes_ to it. On top of that, there is no way for us to reach to the enclosed variable `a` from outside. It seems like `a` can be safely garbage collected. However our test with `queryObjects` tells us the memory allocated for `a` is still retained.

```tsx
function fn() {
  let a;

  return () => {
    a = new Uint8Array(1_000_000_000);
  };
}
const foo = fn();

foo();
queryObjects(Uint8Array); // ‚ùå [uint8Array]
```

In theory a highly-optimized JavaScript engine could release the memory retained for `a` for the case as it is write-only. However it is not an easy task as it faces [the halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem). Furthermore, such a mistake can be easily prevented by [a linter](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-unused-vars).

### setInterval

`setInterval` seems to be another usual suspect for memory leaks. Its recurring nature makes the issue even worse; memory leaks caused by it escalate very quickly.

But first, `setInterval` _alone_ doesn't cause memory leaks. It doesn't prevent the callback passed to it from being garbage collected:

```tsx
const myQueryObject = queryObjects; // had to call the original queryObjects from a different reference

function foo() {
  const array = new Uint8Array(1_000_000_000);

  myQueryObject(Uint8Array); // ‚úÖ empty array
}

setInterval(foo, 1000);
```

In the above example, even though we invoke `foo` every second, `array`'s memory gets released once `foo` finishes execution. No memory leaks happened.

However, nested `setInterval`s cause memory leaks. In the following example we can observe that `queryObjects` logs out an ever-growing array, which gets a new `Uint8Array` added every second.

```tsx
const myQueryObject = queryObjects;

function foo() {
  const array = new Uint8Array(1_000);

  setInterval(() => {
    array; // referencing `array`
  }, 1000);

  myQueryObject(Uint8Array); // üî• ever-growing array of uint8Arrays
}
setInterval(foo, 1000);
```

<details>
    <summary>how do we fix it?</summary>
    <p>
The fix is easy though: just clear the nested `setInterval` via `clearInterval`.

```js
const myQueryObject = queryObjects;

function foo() {
  const array = new Uint8Array(1_000);

  const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
    array; // referencing `array`
  }, 1000);

  myQueryObject(Uint8Array); // ‚úÖ empty array
  clearInterval(intervalId);
}
setInterval(foo, 1000);
```

### Promises

Nolan noted in his [blog post](https://nolanlawson.com/2020/02/19/fixing-memory-leaks-in-web-applications/) on memory leaks related to `Promise`s, ‚ÄúA Promise can leak if it's never resolved or rejected, in which case any¬†`.then()`¬†callbacks attached to it will leak.‚Äù With `queryObjects`, we can easily verify if this is (still) true from your DevTools Console.

In the following code snippet, we create a `Promise` , and that **never** gets resolved or rejected. We then attach a callback that allocates a giant `Uint8Array` to its `then`.

```tsx
const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {});
const giantArrayPromise = p.then(() => new Uint8Array(1_000_000_000));

queryObjects(Uint8Array); // ‚úÖ empty array
```

This is expected. Since it never resolves, the callback is never called. Therefore that `Uint8Array` shouldn't get allocated in the first place.

Maybe Nolan was referring to something slightly different here? Let's tweak the previous example a bit:

```js
let giantArray = new Uint8Array(1_000_000_000);

function foo() {
  const a = giantArray;
  return () => a;
}

const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {});
p.then(foo());

giantArray = null;

queryObjects(Uint8Array); // ‚ùå [uint8Array]
```

This time `Uint8Array` does leak.

The second example looks pretty similar to our first [closure example](#closure). The difference here is that, instead of storing the returned function to a variable like we did in the closure example, we attach that function to a `Promise`'s `then`, and that caused memory leaks.

Lastly, when I was playing around with `Promise` when writing this post, a surprising memory leak occurred when the `resolve` function of a `Promise` is referenced somewhere else:

```js
let i = 0;

while (i++ < 100) {
  new Promise((resolve) => {
    document.body.addEventListener('click', resolve, { once: true });
  });
}

queryObjects(Promise); // ‚ùå Array(100)
```

The event target, which is `document.body` in this case, holds a reference to the `resolve` functions of the `Promise`s and prevent the `Promise`s get collected even after they were resolved. I guess this is probably because every `resolve` has an internal reference back to the `Promise` where it comes from.


We can use `removeEventListener` to fix it:

```js
let i = 0;

while (i++ < 100) {
  const handler = () => resolve();

  new Promise((resolve) => {
    document.body.addEventListener('click', handler, { once: true });
    removeEventListener('click', handler);
  });
}

queryObjects(Promise); // ‚úÖ empty array

```

## Final thoughts

Although `queryObjects` might not help much with debugging memory leaks in production, it serves as a great tool to programmatically detect memory leaks with a quick feedback loop. I found it invaluable when it comes to create a minimal reproducible examples of memory leaks and quickly validate assumptions.

By the way, Safari's DevTools Console has [an API](https://twitter.com/webkit/status/1249747490464616448) called `queryHolders` that lets you which exact variables are holding the reference to the leaking object. Sadly at the time of writing Chrome hasn't implemented this API yet.
